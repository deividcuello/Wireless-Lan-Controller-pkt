## Overview

This repository contains a Cisco Packet Tracer project that demonstrates the setup and management of a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). The project serves as a practical example of how to configure and manage a wireless network using a WLC, including its interactions with access points and wireless clients.

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of networking concepts and Cisco Packet Tracer

## Installation and Setup

1. **Download Cisco Packet Tracer**:
   Ensure that you have Cisco Packet Tracer installed. It can be downloaded from the [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/) or other official Cisco channels.

2. **Open the Project in Packet Tracer**:
   Open the Packet Tracer project file provided in this repository using Cisco Packet Tracer.

3. **Explore the Network Topology**:
   - **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**: Examine how the WLC is configured to manage the wireless network.
   - **Access Points (AP)**: Observe the setup and configuration of access points in relation to the WLC.
   - **Wireless Clients**: Review how wireless clients are configured and their connectivity to the network.

4. **Experiment and Learn**:
   Feel free to modify the project configuration to gain a deeper understanding of wireless network management. Try different settings and observe their impact on network performance and connectivity.

## Usage

1. **Launch Cisco Packet Tracer** and load the project file.
2. **Review the Configuration**: Understand the setup of the WLC, access points, and wireless clients.
3. **Verify Functionality**:
   - Ensure that wireless clients can connect to the network and access necessary resources.
   - Monitor how the WLC manages and controls the access points.

## Troubleshooting

- **Access Points Not Connecting**: Check that the WLC is correctly configured to manage the access points.
- **Clients Unable to Connect**: Verify that the wireless settings and configurations are properly set.
- **Network Issues**: Investigate potential misconfigurations or connectivity problems.
